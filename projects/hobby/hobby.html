    <h1>Eritrean Coffee</h1>
    <h4>Hello, Welcome to my webpage!</h4>
    <p>My name is Mubarak and this is my hobby page where I like to share my love for coffee specifically for Eritrean coffee. I grew up in an East African family where coffee is a ritual that is widely used in family/friends gatherings, celebrations and chit chat. The whole process took about 2-3 hours in the old days since, but nowadays probably an hour. Coffee is made 1-3 times per day. Me and my wife usually do this once a day usually in the morning or afternoon. I enjoy the process as you get to witness and experience every thing from start to finish and of course enjoy a nice tasty aromatic cup of coffee in the end. The Eritrean coffee (Bune) preparation is very similar to the Ethiopian coffee (Buna). </p>
