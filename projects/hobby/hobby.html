  <h1>Eritrean Coffee</h1>
  <hr />
  <h4>Hello, Welcome to my webpage!</h4>
  <p>My name is Mubarak and this is my hobby page where I like to share my love for coffee specifically for Eritrean coffee. I grew up in an East African family where coffee is a ritual that is widely used in family/friends gatherings, celebrations and chit chat. The whole process took about 2-3 hours in the old days since, but nowadays probably an hour. Coffee is made 1-3 times per day. Me and my wife do this once a day usually in the morning or afternoon. I enjoy the process as you get to witness and experience every thing from start to finish and of course enjoy a nice tasty aromatic cup of coffee in the end. The Eritrean coffee (Bune) preparation is very similar to the Ethiopian coffee (Buna). </p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Here are the steps taken to prepare the coffee:</h3>
  <p>
  1) Wash the green coffee beans and then roast them in a small pan (Menkeshkesh).
  <br />
  
  <br />
  2) When the beans are dark enough, the pot is hand around so that everyone can enjoy the aroma.
  <br/>
  <br />
  3) Then the beans are crushed in a mortar (Maukatebune) and sprinkled on a small mat (Meshrefet) with which the ground coffee is poured into the pot (Jebena) together with water as well as with spices like ginger (Jenjeble).
  <br />
  
  <br />
  4) The coffee is boiled for about 30 mins, but should not boil over.
  <br />
  <br />
  5) For coolin, the coffee is therefore poured 3-4 times into a small pot and back again in the pot (Jebena).
  <br />
  <br />
  6) After the coffee is finished, it is poured into a small delicate Porcelain cups (Finjal) with some sugar or no sugar.
