--> About me page

(Portrait here)

Hello! My name is Mubarak Abara, and Iâ€™m a web developer here
in Oakland. I like to code and create good looking websites.
As a child, I always loved collecting tools and materials to 
build houses and that passion grew up with me to now transform
into building websites.

If I am not working, I like to watch movies (I love superhero movies) 
and soccer, my favorite team is the best Italian team Juventus.

and to collaborate with the team.
