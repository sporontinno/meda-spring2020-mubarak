Hello! My name is Mubarak Abara, and Iâ€™m a web developer here
in Oakland. I like to code and create good looking websites.
As a child, I always loved collecting tools and materials to 
build houses and that passion grew up with me to now transform
into building websites.

If I am not working, I like to watch movies (I love superhero movies) 
and soccer, my favorite team is the best Italian team Juventus.

Checkout my resume.

CSS-logo

I write CSS that is easy to read and build on.

I always load my code into Github to share my work
and to collaborate with the team.

Colors
----------


--> Background: lightgrey (whole-page for all pages - #ebebeb -) and lightblue (skills-section - #c9f8ff -)

Lightgrey is a cool and neutral color. It goes well with other colors. It's not
as bright as white, so it can be easier on the eyes.

Blue is the color of sky and sea it's associated with calmness.


--> Text-heading: black

black can highlight text easily.It is a bold and dark color.


--> Text-body: darkgrey

Grey text is softer and can at times be more appealing visually. It makes the page feel lighter.It makes it easier for the user to see black headings.


--> Header-links: dark-grey

It is a dark color. It goes well with the color of the back-ground image.



Fonts
----------



--> Fonts-heading: Palatino

It's a large font that makes it perfect for the web, traditionally used for headings and print-style ads.



--> Fonts-body: Verdana

Likes: The header background changes to a white color when you scroll down.

Likes: design is very nice and professional, nice touch with the project sites and how user can see the different pages in the main section. 
Dislikes: the page is a bit long, maybe add a link to the footer (contact) section.

http://www.mynus.sk/

Likes: Images are clickable, change color (blue) and text appears when the cursor is on the image.
Dislikes: header text is too big, bad font and probably change the footer links, avoid the underlines.
Navigating the website was a bit confusing too.
